# Project Title: Inventory-app

## Project Description

This app was developed to challenge my backend skills in Flask. The application can do the following:

- Create Inventory Items
- View all inventory items stored in the database
- Update Inventory Items
- Delete inventory items.

The app also has an extra feature of being able to create warehouses, and then assign inventory to those warehouses.

## Features

This app used the following technologies:

- Sqlite3 as a database
- Flask WTForms
- Jninja
- Bootstrap
- SQLAlchemy

In addition, the app has a full suite of unit tests, integration tests, as well as comments to document the app's functionality. This means the app will support future developers who wish to add to the application.

## What I learned

This project was a great opportunity to learn more about Replit, and the various technologies it uses. For example, SQLITE. Although it behaves similar to PSQL since
it is a relational database, it was nonetheless interesting to see how much carries over from PSQL.

In addition, it was interesting to explore how inventory applications work. I have worked with various inventory systems in the past, as a user, and it's fascinating the amount of relationships are maintained in large scale inventory system.

## How to run/install the application

The instructions to install/run the application will change depending on whether you are running the application locally or on Replit. I have covered both scenarios below.
